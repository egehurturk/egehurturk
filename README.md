# Hello there

I am a student at Imperial College London pursuing my BEng Computing degree. I love to work on low-level systems, including custom computing, computing architecture, and also love deep learning. The intersection of music and computing fascinates me, which led me to train my own WaveNet to simulate an overdrive pedal. 

Languages: C, C++, Python, Kotlin, Java, Haskell, Swift, JavaScript, Assembly

Feel free to reach out!
